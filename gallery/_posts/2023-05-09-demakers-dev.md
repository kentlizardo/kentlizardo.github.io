    alt: Concept showing what switching consoles would look like if they encompassed the entire viewport. Certain objects are visible only to certain viewports. Made because tiny window size for consoles was limiting in accessibility and usability. It uses a several viewports, UI shaders, and a buffer to mask the previous and next console's screens and scene rendering. (I wanted certain objects to be visible to only some types of consoles)
