# Professional background
I graduated from UIC with a Bachelors in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering.

A list of the tools and topics I worked with/on at UIC.
- C and C++
- C# and F#
- Go
- Javascript & Typescript
- Python
- Ruby
- React.js
- Firebase
- MongoDB and MYSQL2
- Postman
- xv6 operating system
- JIRA
- Kanban

> ***What did you enjoy working with the most?***
> 
> My favorites were **Go** and **Typescript**. The focus on explicit semantics along with the dev environment in those languages made the experience of working with them really smooth. I wish I could use TS's type system in game engines like Godot or Unity. In the future, I'd also like to learn more about **F#** or functional programming.

# Q&A

## What are your interests?
- Video games as both art and software.
	- Graphics and VFX programming.
	- Procedural generation.
	- User experience and accessibility.
- TTRPGs. I've only played and dmed D&D 5E but want to try Call of Cthulhu and Pathfinder 2E.
  - Making character concepts and art.
  - Worldbuilding. I've experimented with using GIS Tools like leaflet and mapbox for making homebrew worlds come to life.
- Digital art. Mostly experienced with pixel art.
- Software development (as a hobby). I'm always looking to improve and learn more about conventions, best practices, and techniques so that I can use them in my own workflows and processes.

## What's your setup for ___?

**Development**

For most software engineering projects, I use **VS Code**. In C#/.NET, **Jetbrains Rider** has really grown onto me, but I have worked much longer with **Visual Studio**.

For version control, I use mainly **Git** & **Git Bash**.

**PKM**

I use **Obsidian** for my personal daybook, writing, project management, and research. I mainly use **Excalidraw**, **Obsidian Canvas**, or even **Paint** for visual organization, but for UML I use Mermaid and PlantUML.

**Ergonomics**

I use a wired low-profile **Lily58 Pro**, using XDA keycaps. I started off using the whole board with Qwerty then quickly switched to Colemak-DH with Callum style mods (34 keys). My mouse is a **Logitech MX Vertical**.

**Art**

I spent a long amount of time using **GIMP** for digital art and image editing, then moved to **Krita** and **Aseprite** for digital and pixel art.

**General**

My daily driver for programming is a *Zephyrus Rog G14*. For my desktop (a gaming prebuilt) I use a *Focusrite Scarlett Solo* with an *AT2020 Condenser Mic*, listening with *ATH-M30x* headphones. My favorite music setup by far is my Qudelix paired with a Koss KSC75.

## Why do you make games?

I started making small games around ~2012 using *Scratch* and *GameMaker: Studio*. When I first had the feeling of starting up my own game made with my own code, there was no going back.

Some of these included a Galaga clone, a Wolfenstein clone, idle clicker game, side scrollers, and more. I also made mods and server plugins for Minecraft to play with friends. I always loved working with new tools and languages; from console applications in Visual Basic, Python and PyGame, to Java and LWJGL, and more.

I stopped making games around high school but got back into it during university when I entered a game jam online.

## Why did you learn programming?

I learned programming alongside game development using things like Windows Forms and VB, Python and Tkinter, and Java. Some projects I made around then were an emailing program, a compiled scripting language, a voice controlled assistant.

When I was younger, I also wanted to work with electronics and microcontroller projects but didn't have access to many of the tools and materials needed; As a result, I spent a larger portion of my time in software.

## What is this site built with?
[Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) by Cotes Chung, hosted with Github Pages using a deploy workflow action (not the automatic branch-based deployment).
