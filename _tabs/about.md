## Professional background
I graduated from UIC with a Bachelors in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering.

A list of the tools and topics I worked with/on at UIC.
- C and C++
- C# and F#
- Go
- Javascript/Typescript
- Python
- Ruby
- React.js
- Firebase
- MongoDB and MYSQL2
- Postman
- xv6 operating system
- x86 & RISC-V Assembly
- Agile, JIRA, Kanban, and Scrum

> ***What did you enjoy working with the most?***
>
> My personal favorites were **Go** and **Typescript**. The focus on explicit semantics along with the dev environment made the experience of working with them really smooth. I wish I could use TS's type system in game engines like Godot or Unity. In the future, I'd also like to learn more about **F#** or functional programming in general.

## Q&A

### How to contact you?

For business or professional reasons, please reach out through [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kentbrianlizardo) or the email below. If you have my number from a provided resume, you may contact me through that as well.

For any other reason, you can [email me](mailto:contact@kentmakes.games) at `contact@kentmakes.games`. It may take me a while to answer, so be patient with me.

### Why do you make games?

I started making small games around ~2010 using *Scratch* and *GameMaker: Studio*. When I first started up my own game, with code I had written myself, that was it for me. I wanted to learn more. Whenever I used any digital program or tool, I would ask: how does this work? How could I make this?

Some of my earliest projects include top-down shooter games, a Wolfenstein clone, an idle clicker game, side scrollers, and more. I often made mods and server plugins for Minecraft to create custom abilities and items to play with friends. I always loved creating and working with new tools and languages, from Visual Basic, to Python and PyGame, to Java and LWJGL, and more.

I stopped making games around high school but got back into it during university when I entered a game jam online. You can find many of the games I made after this point on [my itch.io page](https://gamesbykent.itch.io/).

### Why did you decide on software engineering?

I learned programming alongside game development using frameworks like Windows Forms and VB, Python and Tkinter, and more. Some projects I made around then were an emailing program, a compiled scripting language, a voice-controlled assistant, and others.

When I was younger, I also wanted to work with electronics and microcontroller projects but didn't have access to many of the tools and materials needed; as a result, I spent a larger portion of my time making applications on the software side.

### What is this site built with?
A [modified version](https://github.com/kentlizardo/kentlizardo.github.io) of [Chirpy by Cotes Chung](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/), hosted with Github Pages.

Some changes include but are not limited to:
- A gallery section with responsive masonry and pagination
- Project cards from a `projects` collection
- Pixel art icon for specific site paths

### What are your interests?
- **Video games as both art and software**: The topics mentioned below are ones I am always interested in researching and implementing.
	- Graphics and VFX programming
	- Procedural generation
	- User experience and accessibility
- **TTRPGs**: I've only played and dmed D&D 5E but want to try Call of Cthulhu and Pathfinder 2E.
  - Creating character concepts and art
  - Worldbuilding. I've experimented with using GIS Tools like leaflet and mapbox for making homebrew worlds come to life.
- **Digital art**, though pixel art has been my main focus for longer.
- **Software development** (with regards to my personal growth): I am always exercising effort to ingrain new lessons into my natural thought process for coding, for my code quality to consistently grow while my quick development speed stays at a consistent pace. Part of this growth involves discovering more solutions and researching best practices so that I can use them in my own workflows and projects.

### What's your setup for ___?

**Development**

For most software engineering projects, I use **VS Code**. For C#/.NET specifically, **Jetbrains Rider** has really grown onto me, but I have worked much longer with **Visual Studio**.

For version control, I use mainly **Git** & **Git Bash**.

**PKM**

I use **Obsidian** for my personal daybook, writing, project management, and research. I mainly use **Excalidraw**, **Obsidian Canvas**, or even **Paint** for visual organization, but for UML I use Mermaid and PlantUML.

**Ergonomics**

I use a wired low-profile **Lily58 Pro**, with XDA keycaps. I started off using the whole board with Qwerty then quickly switched to Colemak-DH with Callum style mods (34 keys). My mouse is a **Logitech MX Vertical**.

**Art**

I spent a long amount of time using **GIMP** for digital art and image editing, then moved to **Krita** and **Aseprite** for digital and pixel art.

**General**

My daily driver for programming is a Zephyrus Rog G14.

For my desktop (a gaming prebuilt), my peripherals include a Focusrite Scarlett Solo with an AT2020 Condenser Mic, listening with ATH-M30x headphones. My favorite music setup by far is my Qudelix paired with a Koss KSC75.
