  An application created to post, rate, and detail various study locations across campus through a social network.
  Powered by Google Maps API and Firebase Realtime Database, "silent" spaces are easily located and can be rated depending on accessibility and accommodations. This was the development project my team made for CS 440 Software Engineering I.
