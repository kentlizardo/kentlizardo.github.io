  The development project my team worked on for CS 440 Software Engineering I. An application created to post, rate, and detail various study locations across campus through a social network.
  Powered by Google Maps API and Firebase Realtime Database, "silent" spaces are easily located and can be rated depending on accessibility and accommodations.
